# Paperless-NGX_HP-Scan
This is a simple docker-compose I wanted to share, which combines the super useful [node-hp-scan-to](https://github.com/manuc66/node-hp-scan-to) with Paperless-NGX and a postgres DB. 

# Usage
Simply download the docker-compose file to your local system and place it in a folder where you want your data stored. Tweak as necessary. When you are done, just run `docker-compose up -d` (make sure you are in the same folder with the docker-compose file).
